# Integration

## Hey there :wave:

We are glad that you are working with us! Integrating with such a new technology such as [EOS](eos.md) is somewhat different from traditional apps but its a fun ride!

You can find specific instructions on how to use our APIs to:

- [Create a new account](integration/accounts.md)
- [Fetch user balance](integration/balances.md)
- [Invite users and Query community data](integration/community.md)
